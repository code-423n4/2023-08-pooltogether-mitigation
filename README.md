## Overview of changes

- Twab Controller now checks query timestamps for safety. When requesting a twab, timestamps:
    1. are required to be finalized; i.e. cannot occur during an overwrite period
    2. are aligned to period boundaries.
- Tier adjustment algorithm
    1. The canary tier has been simplified, so that the prize size is adjusted instead of the number of prizes. Now the unified claim count across normal + canary tiers is used to determine the next number of tiers.
- Vault exchange rate
    1. The Vault now assumes shares are 1:1 with underlying assets, unless the vault is undercollateralized. No exchange rate is stored.
